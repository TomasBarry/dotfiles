# Sublime Text Configuration files

This directory contains a set of `.sublime-settings` files. These `.sublime-settings` will:

1. Configure a set of prefences for Sublime Text (rulers, ignored files, etc)
2. Set syntax specific rules (tabs/spaces, indentation amount, etc)
3. Specifiy what packages are to be installed by default

These files should be placed in `/Users/<USER>/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/` or wherever `Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/` lives on your machine. Once placed in that directory, they should just work provided the appropriate dependencies are installed (RuboCop, Node, ESLint, etc).
